## Summary

OAuth stores the identities of users and the correspondent access rights at the IdP (Identity Provider). The IdP does play a crucial role during the OAuth flow as it grants access to clients. To be able to do that it must properly validate parameter which are part of the OAuth flows and the token exchange.

Failure to validate the paramaters may lead to  account takeover, unauthorized ressource access and the elevation of privileges.

## Test Objectives

- Retrieve credentials used for authorization
- Grant yourself access to arbitrary ressources trough forcefull browsing
- Bypass the authorization

## How to test

### Testing for exposed Client Secret

The client secret is used to authenticate the Client against the Authorization Server in order to proof that the Client is a trusted Origin.

Public clients are not able to store the client secret in a secure fashion. Some applications can still store it and rely on it, which can lead to assumptions that the client is strongly authenticated which is not the case.

To identify the client secret in client side code one may conduct reconnaisance on the client side code.

1. Browse to the application
2. Open the Developers Toolbar (F12 in Firefox)
3. Navigate to the Debugger Tab
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+F to open the search
5. Type the search term `client-secret` for example

If this is not successfull one can also step through the authorization process with a MiTM proxy like OWASP ZAP, gather the client secret from the URI in the parameter `client-secret` and replace the search term of the above search with the value of the client secret to reveal the place where it is stored.

## Remediation

### Exposed client secret

Only use client secrets when the client is able to keep them secret (Confidential Client)

- BurpSuite
- OWASP ZAP
